Sabia is a CLI for the Davinci-003 model from OpenAI.
The bot will tell stories, write code, answer questions,
give you recipes, tell you how to build a jet engine, etc.

To begin you must sign up at 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys 
and replace the dead API key in the config.yml file with your API key
it should read apikey: <your api key here>.
That is all you have to do.

# Installation

git clone https://github.com/jbhntr861/Sabia
cd Sabia
sudo apt install python3
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 Sabia

Enjoy.
